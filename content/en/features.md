## Fleetsap Features


 ###   Tanks - Fuel Inventory Management

Fleetsap's tank module feature is an excellent way to keep track of your fuel inventory. The tank module allows you to **always** know how much fuel is in your tank at any given time, past or present. This solution allows you to keep track of your inventory without affecting your operation.

You are able to:

* Instantly see your fuel inventory for as many tanks as you are monitoring at multiple locations.

* Check fuel and [water](/#sensor-applications) [levels](/#sensor-applications) in your tanks.

* See daily fuel transactions from your tank's perspective (*Both Fuel in and Fuel out*)

> **ğŸ’¡ Quick Insight!** - With all of these capabilities, **fleetsap** brings to the customer a better **visibillity** of when fuel should be delivered, received and reconciled.



###  Fuel Dispensing 

This module allows a customer to obtain accurate incoming and outgoing fuel quantities.

You are able to:

* Capture the fuel output from your pumps

* See the fuel transaction coming from your tanks (*i.e - see the tank that the fuel dispensing pump is pulling fuel from*)

![dispense-1](https://i.ibb.co/Pc5ZV0J/fuel-dispense1.png)

* Get information on fuel consumtion per pump, vehicle or driver.

![dispense-2](https://i.ibb.co/3RYcRf8/fuel-dispense2.png)

* Specify the amount of fuel vehicles are allowed to recieve on a daily basis. The system will not allow the pumps to release any fuel once the correct criteria is met.
> **ğŸ’¡ Important Note!** - each vehicle and drivers' information for every fuel transaction is captured by the system through the use of RFID tags as verification. These tags are scanned by our specialized micro-computers (Fuel Shields) as well as an RFID reader on the dispensing pump nozzle that communicates with an RFID ring on each vehicle.

###  GPS Tracking

**Always** know the location of your vehicles and each drivers' behaviour. With **GPS Tracking** comes a greater control over your fleet.

You are able to:

* View the location of any vehicle from your fleet at any given time.

* Recieve alerts on speeding, geofences, hours of operation, unplanned stops, idle time alerts and a host of other alerts that can be specially configured.

###  Telematic Data 

This is the heart of keeping your fleet running and minimizing downtime. With this module you are able to pull **crucial** information from your vehicles.

You are able to:

* See a live view of all the activities taking place at every location being monitored.

* View the history of surveilance footage recorded by your system.

* Integrate with vehicles, buildings, remote sites etc.

###  Reports

The reports module is the location where all information from Fuel Inventory, Fuel Dispensing, GPS Tracking and Telematic Data can be accessed in *report* form. There are many predifined reports that can ge generated from the system for each of the above mentioned modules through the Reports module.

> **ğŸ’¡ Important Note!** -Reports can be generated based on specific conditions such as time & date, vehicle ID, driver ID, location etc.

Some examples of predefined reports are as follows:

**Tanks (Fuel Inventory)** 

- Fuel In Report

- Detailed Events Report(Level Changes,All Fuel Transactions)

**Fuel Dispensing**

- Fuel Exchange Report 

- Vehicle Fuel Report

- Pump Transaction Report
