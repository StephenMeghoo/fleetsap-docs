[**Fleetsap**](https://web.fleetsap.com) is a [cloud](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-the-cloud/) based fuel and fleet management platform designed to capture and monitor all the  fuel transactions within your business or organization combined with additional features such as **GPS Tracking** and **Surveillance**

 ##  How does fleetsap work? 

 Our system can be looked at in three *components* 

 >Sensors > GSM Communicators > Fleetsap Cloud

 Sensors of various kinds that are used in a multitude of applications, collect information that is then sent to **specialized** GSM communicators. These devices communicate over a cellular network, ***forwarding*** the information to the fleetsap platform where it can be accessed by the user.

 >**💡 Quick Note!** Some sensors only give fuel and temperature readings while others give additional information such as water level or water presence in combination with fuel readings. 


* **Temperature Sensors** - Temperature control management. (*used mainly in refridgerated trucks*)
